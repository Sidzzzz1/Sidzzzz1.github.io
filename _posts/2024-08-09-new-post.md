## This is my Second Blog

The flowing things is what I have done today.
1. I learnt some grammar knowledge such as Conditional Adverbial and Subjunctive Mood.
2. I joined an online course for oral speaking training.
3. I sorted out today's grammar and phrase knowledge as well as I made some anki cards for learning language.
4. I recited my Ielts oral test model answer today.
> In conclusion, although I feel exhausted I am excited. Because I can feel my brain absorbing nutrition, the more I pay, the more I recive.
