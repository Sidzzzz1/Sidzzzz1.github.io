Let's talk about something I have done and that I felt good about today.
1. I keep practicing my grammar accurency. Also, I made a lot of memory cards for strength understadiing. Moreover, I made some cards about phrase and idioms which spend me much time.
2. I fond out the prepostion phrase is an essential part for creat sentences. Since, we can use clause to replace specific words that we can't express claerly. However, the prepostion phrase, espically the verb prepostion phrase has a special meaning to content. I decided to learn more verb preposition phrase.
3. I tested my speaking skills again with my teacher and I have a great performance. 
   
> In conclusion, today is great and I hope i can improve more in tomorrow.
