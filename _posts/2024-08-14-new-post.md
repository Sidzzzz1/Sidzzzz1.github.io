Let's talk about something I have done and that I felt good about today.
1. I practiced my speaking skills with my tutor for 2 hours. We did a model speaking test, and she said I could gain 6.5 in modelling test which made me really delightful.  
2. I recited a model answer today. It has nearly 200 words. 
3. I kept learning grammar knowledge and collected many references to make my memory cards.  
   
> In conclusion, today is great and I hope i can improve more in tomorrow.
